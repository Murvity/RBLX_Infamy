# Roblox Infamy Script
This is a script for the game [Infamy](https://www.roblox.com/games/6182305461/Infamy) on Roblox. As of right now, this can be used on both PC and mobile devices.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Main Features

* Auto-Spawn Criminal AI
* Autofarm (abuses streak system)
* Auto-Refill Ammo
* Gamepass Access (Turrets and Jetpack)
* Teleports

Possibly more to be added in the future.

## Some things regarding the autofarm
1. It only works if you are wanted.
2. It gives rewards to you AND other players in your server.
3. Your money may end up frozen until you leave the game. This is the game recognizing the fact that you're cheating.
