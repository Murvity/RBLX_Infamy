# Roblox Infamy Script
This is a script for the game [Infamy](https://www.roblox.com/games/6182305461/Infamy) on Roblox. As of right now, this can be used on both PC and mobile devices.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Main Features

* Server PvP Enabler
* Auto-Kill
* Auto-Spawn Criminal AI
* ~~Autofarm (abuses streak system)~~
* Auto-Refill Ammo
* Gamepass Access (Turrets and Jetpack)
* Teleports

Possibly more to be added in the future.

## Some things regarding the Auto-Kill feature
1. It may lag your game since it's spamming grenades.
2. It is not 100% accurate or optimized, but it somewhat works.
