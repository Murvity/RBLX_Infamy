# Roblox Infamy Script
This is a script for the game [Infamy](https://www.roblox.com/games/6182305461/Infamy) on Roblox. As of right now, this can be used on both PC and mobile devices.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Main Features

* Auto-Spawn Criminal AI
* Auto-Refill Ammo
* Gamepass Access (Turrets and Jetpack)
* Teleports

Possibly more to be added in the future.

## Important

As of 3/14/2025, many of the features in this script were patched. Here's all you need to know:

* Automatically spawning criminal AI still works
* Refilling ammo is much slower than before
* Using the 'free' gamepass toggle will result in being kicked from the game after a short while

Right now, I don't see any workarounds to these changes made by the creator. The most likely scenario here is that there is now proper server-side validation in the game. With that said, enjoy what's left of this script!
